# ðŸ§ª Skin Cancer Detection using CNN & Streamlit

A deep learning-based web application to classify **skin cancer** as **Benign** or **Malignant** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deployed using **Streamlit**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses image classification techniques with a CNN model trained on a dataset of skin lesion images to automate the detection of malignant and benign skin conditions.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and follows a custom CNN architecture with the following layers:

- **Conv2D + MaxPooling** (3 blocks: 32, 64, 128 filters)
- **Flatten Layer**
- **Dense Layer (512 neurons + Dropout 0.5)**
- **Final Output Layer (Sigmoid activation)** for binary classification

### ðŸ”§ Model Compilation
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

Organize your dataset as follows:

data\
â”œâ”€â”€ train\
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ benign\
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ malignant\
â””â”€â”€ test\
â”œâ”€â”€ benign\
â””â”€â”€ malignant


Each class folder should contain respective images.

## ðŸ“Š Training Configuration

- **Image Size:** 224x224  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Epochs:** 30  
- **EarlyStopping:** Enabled (patience=5)  
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Enabled (factor=0.3, patience=3)  
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotation, shift, shear, zoom, flip  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Training History

After training, the model achieves good validation accuracy and balanced performance on both classes. A confusion matrix and classification report are plotted for evaluation.

---

## âœ… Predictions

The model takes an image as input and returns:
- **Prediction:** "Benign" or "Malignant"
- **Visualization:** Displays the image with the prediction label

---

## ðŸ’» Streamlit App

You can run the web app with Streamlit for easy deployment and usage.

### ðŸ“¦ Required Libraries

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow
```

## ðŸ’¾ Model Saving

```bash
